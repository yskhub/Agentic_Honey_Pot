# Next.js Judge UI (preview)

This is a minimal Next.js scaffold for a judge-facing UI. It expects the backend to expose simple admin endpoints that return JSON for sessions. It's a preview scaffold — adapt as needed for the competition.

Run locally:

```bash
cd frontend/nextjs
npm install
npm run dev
```

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` to point to your backend if it's not on localhost.
